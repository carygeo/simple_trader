- AVAX: STOCH_RSI, MULTI_TF_MACD_RSI, MOMENTUM_ROC, MEAN_REV_KELTNER

## Issues Encountered
- Process killed due to memory/time constraints
- Warning: "More than 20 figures have been opened" - matplotlib memory issue
- Need to close figures after saving to reduce memory footprint

## Recommendations

2. Consider running backtests in smaller batches
3. Or run during longer uninterrupted sessions
