## Key Findings

### 1. ETH Outperforms Other Assets
- ETH SMA 3/10: +125.1% (no leverage)
- DOGE SMA 3/10: +49.9%
- XRP: -0.3%
- BTC: +19.7%
- SOL: -23.7%

### 2. Fast SMA Periods Work Best
- SMA 3/10 beats SMA 20/50 by a huge margin
- Faster signals catch more of the moves
- But also generate more trades (fees matter!)

### 3. Leverage is the Key to 1000%+
- Without leverage, max return ~125%
- 5x leverage turns 125% into 1,322%
- But drawdowns scale proportionally

### 4. Stop Losses Have Mixed Results
- Don't trigger often with SMA signals
- Main protection is from the SMA exit signal itself
- 10-15% stop loss provides some extra protection

## ⚠️ Important Caveats

1. **Transaction Fees Not Included**
   - ~1,000 trades × 0.1% = 100% in fees
   - Real returns could be 100-200% lower

2. **Slippage Not Modeled**
   - Fast markets = worse fills
   - Could add another 50-100% drag

3. **Leverage Risks**
   - 84.9% drawdown at 5x leverage
   - Margin calls / liquidation possible
   - Psychological torture to watch

4. **Past ≠ Future**
   - ETH had specific market conditions in 2025
   - May not repeat

## Recommendations

### Conservative (Safer Start)
- **2x leverage**: +291% return, -57% max drawdown
- Lower risk, still beats S&P 500 by 10x

### Moderate (Balanced)
- **3x leverage**: +442% return, -73% max drawdown
- Good risk/reward ratio

### Aggressive (Target 1000%+)
- **5x leverage + 12% SL**: +1,322% return, -85% max drawdown
- Only for money you can afford to lose

## Next Steps

1. **Paper trade for 1 month** - Validate in real-time
2. **Add fee simulation** - More realistic returns
3. **Test on 2024 data** - Check consistency
4. **Implement trailing stops** - Lock in gains
5. **Consider position sizing** - Kelly criterion
